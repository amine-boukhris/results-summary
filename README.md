## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Media-query

### What I learned

I used linear-gradients for the first time and later I knew that we use them in a background-image.
I learned that css transition property doesn't work with linear-gradient.
Discovered how to capitalize a text by using text-transform: capitalize;

### Continued development

I don't quite understand how aspect-ratio behaves or why it's not highlighted by vscode so I'll watch a tuto on that.
making it mobile responsive wasn't hard for this design but I need to try mobile-first design.

## Acknowledgments

I want to say thank u for the 4am motivation at the weekend. without it, i would delay this design for another month.
